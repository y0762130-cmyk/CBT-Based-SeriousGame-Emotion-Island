# CBT-Based-SeriousGame-Emotion-Island
Our project, "Emotion Island" is a therapeutic sandbox game designed to help teenagers manage anxiety. Players explore 3 different catboxes that each represent a unique emotional challenge and get 9 items. Using the symbolic items, players finally create their own peaceful island helping them express and understand their feelings.
